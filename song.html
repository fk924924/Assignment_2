                For all the times that you rained on my parade
                And all the clubs you get in using my name
                You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake
                You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't</span></p>

                [Refrain]
                And I didn't wanna write a song
                'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
                I don't, but you still hit my phone up
                And baby, I'll be movin' on
                And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
                Maybe you should know that</span></p>
            <p><span class="reflective">[Pre-Chorus]
                My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
                And I never like to admit that I was wrong
                And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
                But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

            <p><span class="assertive">[Chorus]
                'Cause if you like the way you look that much
                Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
                And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
                You should go and love yourself</span></p>
